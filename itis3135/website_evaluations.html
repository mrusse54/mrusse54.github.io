        <section>
        <h3 class="headings"><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">YALE SCHOOL Â­OF ART</a></h3>
        <p>Yale's School of Art website is a collaborative website treated as a wiki meant for digital publishing and information sharing amongst students, staff, and alumni.</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="lispacing">Contrast: The page has many different colors, fonts, and images that result in there being no central focal point to look at. For this reason, I do not think it follows C in CRAP. </li>
            <li class="lispacing">Repetition: There is some repetition on the website page that includes fonts, colors, and shapes, but there is no overall scheme in design. For this reason, I do not think it follows R in CRAP.</li>
            <li class="lispacing">Alignment: The content of the pages does follow a clear line that can be tracked throughout the page. For this reason, I think it follows the A in CRAP.</li>
            <li class="lispacing">Proximity: Everything is sectioned off nicely, so the viewer knows what content relates to each section. For this reason, I think it follows the P in CRAP.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 class="headings"><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
        <p>Apple's website is meant for old and new customers to buy new products, receive product support, or learn about new and upcoming products.</p>
        <ul class = "ULspacing">
            <li class="lispacing">Contrast: Apple's contrast is excellent. Nothing on the page blends in or causes reduced visibly. The page is easy to read, and the difference of each element draws my attention. For this reason, I do think it follows C in CRAP.</li>
            <li class="lispacing">Repetition: The fonts, font size, section size, and button shape stay the same throughout the page. For this reason, I don't think it follows R in CRAP.</li>
            <li class="lispacing">Alignment: The alignment on the page is different. The text and images alternate between three different positions. Each section aligns with another section seen on the page, which also adds to repetition. For this reason, I think it follows the A in CRAP.</li>
            <li class="lispacing">Proximity: The sections are cleanly divided and separated. All of the information needed for products is given within the section. For this reason I think it follows the P in CRAP.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
